Below we show how we connect all these componenents
## üß© Use of Each Component

### üîå DC-DC XL4015 Adjustable Step-down Module (5A 75W with Digital Voltmeter)
This power module is used to **step down the voltage** from our 2s2p 18650 battery pack (8.4V when fully charged) to a stable **5.2V**, which is ideal for powering the **Raspberry Pi 5**.  
The built-in digital display helps us monitor the output voltage easily and adjust it precisely, ensuring the Raspberry Pi receives clean and safe power throughout operation.

---

### üß† Raspberry Pi 5
This serves as the **main processing unit or brain** of our robot. It handles:
- Real-time image processing from the camera module  
- Sensor data interpretation  
- Pathfinding algorithms and decision-making logic  
- Communication with the Arduino Nano  

We chose the Raspberry Pi 5 due to its powerful processor, increased RAM, and GPIO compatibility, making it perfect for compute-heavy robotics tasks.

---

### üì∑ Raspberry Pi 12MP Camera Module 3
This camera captures **high-resolution images** of the game field, which are then processed by the Raspberry Pi for tasks such as:
- Line and object detection  
- Path planning  
- Visual-based decisions  

Its high quality and native Pi compatibility make it ideal for real-time computer vision applications.

---

### üß∞ Arduino Nano
The **Arduino Nano** is used as a dedicated microcontroller to:
- Interface with motor drivers  
- Control the steering servo and drive motors  
- Execute low-level, timing-critical control tasks  

This division of labor makes the control system more efficient and responsive.

---

### üìè 10kŒ© Resistor
We use this as a **pull-down resistor** in our push button circuit to ensure that the GPIO pin connected to the button reads a stable LOW state when the button is not pressed, preventing **false signals**.

---

### üîò Push Button
A simple button used to **start or stop the robot's program**.  
It gives us manual control over the code execution without needing remote access or a keyboard.

---

### üîã 18650 Lithium-ion Batteries (2s2p Configuration)
We wired four 18650 cells in a **2-series 2-parallel** configuration to:
- Get a nominal voltage of 7.4V (8.4V when fully charged)  
- Double the capacity and current output  

This ensures sufficient runtime and power delivery for the Raspberry Pi and motors.

---

### üßµ Jumper Wires
Used to connect various components such as:
- Sensors to the Raspberry Pi  
- GPIO pins to the button and ultrasonic module  

They offer flexibility and are great for testing and prototyping.

---

### üîå USB Cable A to Mini B
This cable connects the **Raspberry Pi to the Arduino Nano**, enabling:
- Power supply to the Arduino  
- Serial communication for sending control commands  

Essential for integrating the two microcontrollers.

---

### üöó LaTrax Rally 75054 Chassis
This is a **commercial RC car chassis** we used as the robot's base. It provides:
- A strong and stable platform  
- Built-in drivetrain and suspension  
- Easy mounting for electronics and sensors  

It reduced the time spent on mechanical design and improved mobility and reliability.

---

### üé• Raspberry Pi FPC Camera Cable (Standard-Mini)
This flexible flat ribbon cable connects the **Camera Module 3** to the Raspberry Pi.  
The mini connector fits perfectly with our camera, and the cable length allows us to position the camera optimally for capturing the game field.

# Circuit Diagram
![](other/readme-images/circuit-diagram.jpg)

This circuit diagram represents the core electronic system of our robot, powered by two distinct battery packs and controlled using both an **Arduino Nano** and a **Raspberry Pi 5**. Each component is strategically connected to fulfill its specific function in the robot's operation.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Power Supply and Regulation

- The system uses two battery packs:
  - A **2S2P 18650 Li-ion battery pack** to power the Raspberry Pi through a **DC-DC XL4015 step-down converter**, which regulates the voltage from 8.4V down to 5.2V to ensure safe operation of the Pi.
  - A **6000mAh 7.4V LiPo battery** is dedicated to powering the **DC motor** via an **ESC (Electronic Speed Controller)**, providing the high current required for reliable movement and acceleration.

### üß† Microcontroller & Microprocessor

- The **Raspberry Pi 5** serves as the central processing unit of the robot. It:
  - Processes data from the **Raspberry Pi Camera Module**
  - Sends movement instructions to the **Arduino Nano**
  - Interfaces with input components like the **push button** through GPIO pins

- The **Arduino Nano** is responsible for:
  - Receiving control commands from the Raspberry Pi
  - Driving the **servo motor** for steering
  - Sending PWM signals to the **ESC** to control the DC motor
  - Handling low-level real-time tasks for precise control

### üì∑ Camera Integration

A **12MP Camera Module 3** is connected to the Raspberry Pi using a **FPC ribbon cable**. This camera captures visual data from the field for image processing tasks such as:
- Line tracking
- Object detection
- Lane following and obstacle avoidance

This enables the robot to make autonomous navigation decisions based on what it "sees."

### üîÅ Actuation

- A **DC motor**, connected through an **ESC**, provides torque and speed for forward and backward movement.
- A **servo motor** controls the steering mechanism of the chassis, allowing the robot to make turns with precision.

### üéÆ Input and Control

- A **push button** is connected to the Raspberry Pi via GPIO pins and a **10kŒ© resistor** (as a pull-down resistor) to prevent floating values. This button is used to **start or stop** the program execution manually.
- **Jumper wires (UTP)** are used to make precise connections between components like the sensors, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi, ensuring signal integrity and clean communication.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

This modular design ensures:
- **Separation of logic and power domains**, preventing electrical noise or surges from affecting control logic
- **Efficient power delivery** to both the Raspberry Pi and motors
- **Clear division of responsibilities** between the Raspberry Pi (for high-level processing) and Arduino (for motor control)
- **Scalability**, allowing us to easily modify or extend the system for future challenges

The diagram illustrates a robust and well-integrated control system suitable for real-world robotic competitions, ensuring stability, performance, and flexibility in operation.
